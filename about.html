			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a work of my course "Web Program Design".Implement base feature such as log in, post request, read rss and so on.
			<br/><br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it's just a practice, too much time spend on developing it. To design a website for reading RSS, I have to study too many things, such as PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and so on.
			<br/><br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cost me too much time, so I will not discard it immediatly. If someone interesting about that, or want to study how to design an website, I'd like to have a study experience together. :)

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note:It just a test which have not service to run it(maybe just for study?). You can touch me by follow ways:
